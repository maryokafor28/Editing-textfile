This project is a simple invitation editor where users can flip through slides, 
edit the text, change styles (fonts, size, colors), and even drag the text around to position 
it wherever they like.

It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks) 
making it easy to understand for beginners.
